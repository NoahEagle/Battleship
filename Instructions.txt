HOW TO PLAY BATTLESHIP

1.) You, the player must first place your ships on the right board.

Boats are placed via clicking on a box on the player board.

They are placed in the following order: Carrier (takes 5 spots),
Battleship (takes 4 spots), Cruiser (takes 3 spots),
Submarine (takes 3 spots), and Destroyer (takes 2 spots).

Each ship is placed going downwards starting from the box you click.
You can not place a boat that goes partially (or fully) out of bounds,
and you also may not place boats over one another.

During ship placement, you may click the undo button to remove the most
recently placed ship (clicking multiple times removes multiple ships)
and then re-place those ships.

Only once you've placed all 5 ships can you proceed to part 2.

2.) You must now fire upon the computer's board (the left board).

You fire via clicking on a box on the computer board.

Once you fire your first shot, your boat placement will be locked in
(the Undo button ceases to work).

If you fire and the square turns white, that means you missed (there was no ship
there).
If you fire and the square turns red, that means you shot a ship.
If you fire and squares turn black, that means you sunk a ship
(that node was the final unshot node on the ship).
If you try to fire upon a white, red, or black square, nothing will happen
(there's no point in repeat shooting).

Every time you fire upon the computer, the computer will fire upon your board.

Whoever sinks all of their opponent's ships first wins!

EXTRA NOTES:

***If you score better (meaning it took you fewer shots to win) than our previous
best winners, you'll be prompted to enter your initials and your score will be
recorded in the high scores)***

***You can check the aforementioned high scores by clicking the High Scores button***
